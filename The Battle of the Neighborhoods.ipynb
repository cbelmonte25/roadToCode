    "Before we dive in to what you're really here for, I wanted to share my thoughts on my journey through this course. I came in with basically zero knowledge of any of these concepts, and much worse...zero programming (read: Python) experience. I am very happy to report that this class has made me come a long way, but I am walking away (especially after all of the struggles it took get this capstone done!!) knowing where to focus myself - I look forward to deep diving into Python now that this course is coming to a close for me. I feel that to fully take advantage of the concepts & libraries presented in this course, I really need to sharpen my Python.\n",

    "Luckily, we live in a world (world-wide-web) full of open data sets. I knew I wanted to segment the city of Miami by its Zip Codes, so I first went on the hunt for a data set that contained all of the zip codes in Miami. I was able to find and download one from <a href=\"https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/?sort=modified\">ODS</a>. Next, I needed to locate data on property values in the City of Miami. This data was actually quite easy to locate and extract, as <a href=\"https://gis-mdc.opendata.arcgis.com/\">Miami-Dade County (where the city sits) has an open data hub as well</a>. The final component would be data on nearby venues for each zip code. Based on the labs done with Foursquare, we will use the Foursquare API as the source of our venue data based on our zip codes. Putting all of these pieces together, we'll be able to explore Miami's zip codes to figure out where we can buy real estate sensibly but still have access to the amazing things Miami has to offer."

    "After closely looking at each cluster, it seems there is much room for improvement. Zip codes were densely clustered between Clusters 1 and 6. Cluster 1 is all over the place and doesn't provide much insight. However, Cluster 6 is our gold mine. We can see that the zip codes in Cluster 6 boast very reasonable property prices, fair bed/bath distribution and access to a plethora of awesome nearby venues. Based on this finding, I would recommend that any average buyer looking to purchase real estate in Miami, Fl further explore the zip codes in Cluster 6. \n",

    "In terms of where to steer these efforts in the future, my thoughts are as follows:\n",
    "Given the complexity of a city like Miami, very different approaches can be tried in clustering and classification studies. However, not every method can yield the same high quality results for this metropolis. I used the KMeans Clustering because of its speed and efficacy. However, given the results it is clear that for more in-depth guidance, the data set should be expanded and the details of the neighborhood and/or street should be further looked into. I hope that as this information is refined, it would be subsequently turned into an easy to access web app that can be accessed via mobile or even a chat-based interface!"

    "In conclusion, we set out to recommend Miami viable zip codes for average home buyers who want to pay reasonable prices but still have access to a good variety of Miami's venues. We did so by gathering zip code data, property data and Foursquare location data on the city of Miami. We used this information to cluster Miami zip codes and then further explore those clusters. As time goes on, I hope to refine this project so that I may share it with my friends and network of real estate agents in Miami - we have all been curious about this for as long as I can remember and currently only have anecdotal data to serve us."
